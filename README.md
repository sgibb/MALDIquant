Quantitative Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data


## Description

MALDIquant provides a complete analysis pipeline for
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF)
and other two-dimensional mass spectrometry data.

In addition to commonly used plotting and processing methods it
includes distinctive features, namely baseline
subtraction methods such as morphological filters (TopHat) or the
statistics-sensitive non-linear iterative peak-clipping algorithm
(SNIP), peak alignment using warping functions, handling of replicated
measurements as well as allowing spectra with different resolutions.

## Contact

You are welcome to:

* submit suggestions and bug-reports at: <https://github.com/sgibb/MALDIquant/issues>
* send a pull request on: <https://github.com/sgibb/MALDIquant/>
* compose an e-mail to: <mail@sebastiangibb.de>


## Install

You can install the latest release directly from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MALDIquant/index.html).

```r
install.packages("MALDIquant")
```

## Install development version (not recommended)

[GitHub](https://github.com) is not directly supported by the basic
`install.packages` command. You could use the
[devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html) package
to install the development version of MALDIquant
(you will need a complete development environment to compile the some c code).

```r
install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")
install_github("sgibb/MALDIquant")
```

## Examples
To illustrate the application of MALDIquant for analyses of mass spectrometry
data please find a number of example R scripts in the
[MALDIquantExamples](https://github.com/sgibb/MALDIquantExamples) repository.
